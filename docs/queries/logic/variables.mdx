Variables and constants in SQL allow you to dynamically insert and manipulate content within SQL queries.

Variables can change their value throughout the query, while constants retain their initial value once set.

## Variables
Variables are placeholders that can be assigned and reassigned values throughout the SQL template. They are defined using curly braces and can be manipulated or updated.

### Assignment
To assign a value to a variable, use the equal sign = followed by the value.
```
{name = 'foo'}
{age = 30}
{sum = 2 + 4}
```
### Incrementing
Variables can be modified using operations such as addition.
```
{counter = counter + 1}
{counter += 1}
```
### Usage in Queries
Variables can be used directly in SQL queries.

```
WHERE id != {idFilteredList}
```

## Constants
Constants are similar to variables but, once defined, their value cannot be changed. They are defined using the @const keyword.

```
{@const name = 'value'}
```

## Scope
### Global
Variables defined outside of any logical blocks are considered global and can be modified and accessed throughout the entire template.
```
{var1 = 'latitude'}
```

### Local Variables
Variables defined within logical blocks are local to that block. They cannot be accessed outside the block in which they are defined.
``` 
{#if condition}
    {var2 = 'localValue'} -- Accessible only within this block
{/if}
```
