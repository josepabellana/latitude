title: 'Interpolate Values'
description: 'Insert values dynamically into SQL queries'
---

Interpolating values allows you to reuse the same value or change it dynamically along the entire SQL query.

## Syntax

### Variable Interpolation

```
 WHERE company = '{'companyFiltered'}'
 ---
 WHERE company = 'latitude'
 ```

## Parametization
To avoid SQL injections, queries are parametized. You can skip the parametization with `unsafeParam`.

```
SELECT {'latitude'} AS {unsafeParam('column_name')}
```
