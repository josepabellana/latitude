Before you start retrieving data, there are two important things to consider: the configuration of the query files and the sources from which you will retrieve data.

## File Requirements

Queries are stored in files, and here are the necessary specifications and options:

- **Source files:** Must be `.sql`.
- **Location:** All query files should be placed in the `queries` directory. This includes nesting in any subdirectories under `queries`.
- **Reuse Queries** It's possible to reuse the results of one query in another. See [Referencing other queries](sql-syntax-basics#from) for more information.
- **Subqueries:** Each `.sql` file represents a single query, which can include subqueries or CTEs. Alternatively, you may split subqueries into separate files and reference them as required. The approach is entirely up to you..
- **Naming:** The `.sql` filename is the one you can use to reference one query in another.
- **Co-location:** `.sql` query files and `.yaml` source files must all reside within the queries directory or its subdirectories.

## Sources

### Configuration
<Note>The first step is to configure a source. To learn more about how to do this, see [How to configure Sources](../../sources/how-to-configure-sources.mdx)</Note>

### Source Resolution
<Note>It is important understand the source resolution when creating a query. [Check Source Resolution](../../sources/how-to-configure-sources#source-esolution)</Note>
