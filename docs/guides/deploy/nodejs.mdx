## Introduction

You can build the production version of your Latitude project as a standalone
NodeJS application. This approach is useful if you want to avoid the
complexities of Docker, but it complicates deployment if you are not used to
deploying to bare metal servers or other non-containerized environments.

## Build

To build the NodeJS production version of Latitude project app, run the following command:

```bash
latitude build
```

This command will build your app in a `build` directory at the root of your
project. Once completed, access the build folder:

```bash
cd build
```

And run your app:

```bash
node build
```
